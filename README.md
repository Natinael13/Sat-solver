# SAT-Solver

A series of 3 small exercises culminating into a larger exercise 4: Function solve-sat, which searches for a satisfying assignmentâ€”that is, a mapping of Boolean variables to Boolean values that makes a formula true using continuation-passing style.

# What I Learned

* Practice writing functions in continuation-passing style
* Practice defining and using higher-order, polymorphic functions
* Application of my functional programming knowledge to solve a real-world problem in computer science: Boolean Satisfiability
